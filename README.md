# Numerical-Integration
Numerical Integration and passing functions as arguments
This is a classic computational method and a good exercise of our growing understanding of algorithms and Python syntax.
Open Numerical Integration Jupyter Notebook and run the code. You will be able to use integration methods such as Rectangular, Trapezoidal, Simpsons methods.
